Problem 1

This is a classic problem given in technical interviews. First solve the problem WITHOUT using list comprehension.

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number. For Multiples of five print "Buzz". Finally, for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Include comments for each step of your script explaining the Pseudo code/what each line is doing.

After you have solved it, write a second version of your script using list comprehension.
